**CORS**
* Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) 
* Cors will allows resources on a web page to be requested from another outside the domain from which first resource was served.  
* JavaScript can only make calls to URLs that live on the same origin as the location where the script is running. 
* CORS _failures_ result in errors, but for security reasons, specifics about the error are not available to JavaScript.
* The only way to determine what specifically went wrong is to look at the __browser's console__ for details.
