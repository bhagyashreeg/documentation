**Difference between classes in java and  classes in javascript**

* JavaScript is an object based scripting language, whereas Java is an OOP programming language.
* Java applications can run in any virtual machine(JVM) or browser, while JavaScript code run on browser only.
* Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code does not.
* Java is a Standalone language, whereas Javascript contained within a web page and integrates with its HTML content.
* In JavaScript we don't define classes and create objects from these classes.
* JavaScript is prototype based, not class based.
* To do inheritance, you can use any object instance as a prototype
* In other programming languages there are classes, and instances, as separate concepts. In order to do inheritance, you have to use the base class to create a new class, which can then be used to produce derived instances.
