**Hoisting**

* Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
* It means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.
* JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.
