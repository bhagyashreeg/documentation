**Synchronous in javascript**

* Two or more things that happen at same time
* Javascript is a single threaded and it has synchronous model.
* It wil execute one command at a time.
* Ex: 
        In synchronous programs, if we  have two lines of code (L1 followed by L2), then L2 cannot begin running until L1 has finished executing.



**Asynchronous in javascript**

* JavaScript is only asynchronous in the sense that it can make, for example, Ajax calls.
* Async functions will always return  a value.
* Ex :
        In asynchronous programs, we can have two lines of code (L1 followed by L2), where L1 schedules some task to be run in the future, but L2 runs before that task completes.
